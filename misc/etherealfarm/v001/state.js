  factor for overconsumption:
  say there is a berry producing seeds, and a mushroom consuming seeds but producing spores:
  then if there is not enough production from the berry, the mushroom will produce less spores.
  the "over" value defines how much of the production of the berry, the mushroom is allowed to use.
  If this value is 1, then the mushroom can consume max 100% of the seeds production, but not more (no negative total seeds production)
  If this value is infinity, then the mushroom always consumes any amount of seeds and has 100% of its spores production, but there can be a total negative seeds produciton then. This game does not allow this.
  If this value is 0.5, then the mushroom can consume max 50% of the seeds production. The remaining seeds production always goes to the player's resources.
  If this value would be 0, no consumption at all is allowed and the mushroom can never produce spores.
  Good values are:
  *) 0.5 for a safe early game experience (where you can't get blocked by no seeds production due to expensive mushrooms you'd find too painful to delete)
  *) 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, ... as options that can unlock later in the game for the more experienced player, and the player can then choose between e.g. with a slider
  *) 1 as a possible more dangerous lategame option
